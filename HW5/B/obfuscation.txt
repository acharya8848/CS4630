2. On analyzing the file "foobar.c", it seems as though the split obfuscation
	was applied to it using the tigress tool. The function "subroutine1" seems
	to have been split into two parts called:

		- _1_subroutine1_subroutine1_split_1
		- _1_subroutine1_subroutine1_split_2

	The first split intializes local variables i, j, and k of subroutine1 to
	c, b, and a respectively. The second split then performs the following
	operation 10 times before returning back:

		- sum = i + j + k

	After the second split, subroutine1 then returns the value in sum.

	The obfuscated function subroutine1 takes three integer arguments, adds
	them together and returns the final sum to the caller.


3. After a rundown of the control flow for the function, the following seems
	to be the deobfuscated version of the given function:

		int barfoo(int x, int y) {
			return 14;
		}
