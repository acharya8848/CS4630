// Use a text editor of your choice to type in your responses to the following questions.  Add additional space as needed for your responses..

// NOTE:  When a question asks for the address of a variable, your answer
should be of the form of the effective/register-relative address of the variable.
For example, 55(\%ebp), 25(\%esp), 10(\%eax)

Part 1:  Analyzing Assembly Code (Analyze code.s)

1. What is the address of local variable i of function main?
-> 'i' is at %ebp - 12



2. What is the address of local variable sum of function main?
-> 'sum' is at %epb - 16



3. What is the address of local variable x of function main?
-> 'x' is at %ebp - 20



4. What is the address of local variable buffer of function main?
-> buffer starts at %ebp - 84



5. What is the address of the address of the parameter vector of function baz? 
-> in the function baz, vector parameter is at %ebp + 8



6. What is the address of parameter len of function baz?
-> in the function baz, len parameter is at %ebp + 12



7. What is the address of parameter value of function baz?
-> in the function baz, value parameter is at %ebp + 16



8. What is the address of local variable i of function baz?
-> in the function baz, i is at %ebp - 4


Part 2:  Analyzing Disassembled Code (Analyze your disassembly of funcs.exe)

1. List the names of the functions called in main.
-> the function main calls functions f1, f2, f3 and printf



2. How many parameters does the function f1 take?
-> f1 takes 3 parameters


3. How many parameters does the function f2 take?
-> f2 takes 2 parameters


4. How many parameters does the function f3 take?
-> f3 takes 2 parameters


5. Does f1 have any local variables? If so, how many and at what memory addresses? 
-> f1 has no local variables


6. Does f2 have any local variables? If so, how many and at what memory addresses? 
-> f2 moved the stack up by 16, so it has 

7. Does f3 have any local variables? If so, how many and at what memory addresses? 
-> f3 has no local variables


8. Describe the calculation that function f1 performs.
-> f1 performs floating point addition on the 3 parameters given to it and returns the result


9. Describe the calculation that function f2 performs.
-> f2 performs integer multiplication on the two parameters given to it and returns the result


10. Describe the calculation that function f3 performs.
-> f3 divides the second argument by the first one and returns the result
